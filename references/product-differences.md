# Sovereign Cloud Product Differences vs Public GCP

Per-product differences and limitations when running on Google Cloud Dedicated (Berlin, `u-germany-northeast1`) and Cloud de Confiance by S3NS (France, `u-france-east1`) compared to public Google Cloud. Each section lists what is unavailable or changed.

All products share these platform-wide constraints:
- **Single region with three zones:** `u-germany-northeast1` (`-a`, `-b`, `-c`) for Berlin; `u-france-east1` (`-a`, `-b`, `-c`) for S3NS. No multi-region features or cross-region failover.
- **Project IDs:** Prefixed with `eu0:` (Berlin) or `s3ns:` (S3NS).
- **Service endpoints:** `*.apis-berlin-build0.goog` (Berlin) or `*.s3nsapis.fr` (S3NS) instead of `*.googleapis.com`.
- **No Cloud Identity or Google Accounts:** Use Workforce Identity Federation or service accounts.
- **No Cloud Shell:** Install `gcloud` and CLI tools locally or on a sovereign cloud VM.

- **Hardware and OS — GPUs and TPUs:** GPUs are available on A3 machine types. The only available Edge machine type is `a3-edgegpu-8g-nolssd` and it must be set explicitly by using a [custom ComputeClass](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/autopilot-gpus#request-machine-custom). TPUs are unavailable.
- **Hardware and OS — Release channels:** Only the Stable and Regular release channels are available. For clusters enrolled in the Rapid channel, the features might be available in preview.
- **Hardware and OS — GKE Hypercluster:** GKE Hypercluster isn't available.
- **Availability and disaster recovery — Regions and zones:** Cloud de Confiance has only a single region, though with multiple zones. Multi-region features and cross-region failover are not supported. Deployment across multiple zones for resiliency is supported.
- **Availability and disaster recovery — Storage:** The only storage type available is Hyperdisk Balanced. All other storage types are unavailable. Because other storage types are unavailable, using automated disk type selection with a fallback to Persistent Disk is unavailable.
- **Availability and disaster recovery — Backup for GKE:** Backup for GKE is unavailable.
- **Availability and disaster recovery — Autoscaling:** Some customization options are unavailable: - The Performance HPA profile is unavailable. - The VPA `InPlaceOrRecreate` mode is unavailable.
- **Cost management — Cost optimization metrics:** Some cost optimization recommendations might be unavailable.
- **Cost management — Committed use discounts (CUDs):** Cloud de Confiance by S3NS offers compute flexible committed use discounts (CUDs) for eligible spend on GKE. To purchase compute flexible commitments, contact [ Cloud de Confiance by S3NS billing support](https://support.s3ns.fr/). For more information, see the [billing differences page](/billing/docs/tpc-differences).
- **Integrations — Cloud Storage:** Transferring data from Cloud Storage by using GKE Volume Populator is unavailable.
- **Integrations — Cloud Storage FUSE:** The [Cloud Storage FUSE](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cloud-storage-fuse-csi-driver) CSI driver is supported on clusters and node pools running GKE version 1.36.0-gke.1266000 or later. Configuration requirements depend on your GKE version: - **GKE version 1.36.0-gke.2684000 or later**: specify the `skipCSIBucketAccessCheck: "true"` volume attribute. The `custom-endpoint` mount option is not required because the CSI driver automatically discovers the storage endpoint. - **GKE versions between 1.36.0-gke.1266000 and 1.36.0-gke.2684000**: specify both the `skipCSIBucketAccessCheck: "true"` volume attribute and the `custom-endpoint` mount option. To configure these settings: - Specify the `skipCSIBucketAccessCheck: "true"` volume attribute in the PersistentVolume specification or Pod's ephemeral storage volume attributes. For example: ``` volumeAttributes : skipCSIBucketAccessCheck : "true" ``` - *(Versions between 1.36.0-gke.1266000 and 1.36.0-gke.2684000 only)* Specify the `custom-endpoint` mount option in the volume's `mountOptions`, either in a Pod's ephemeral storage volume or in a PersistentVolume, to point to the Cloud Storage API endpoint for your environment: `storage.s3nsapis.fr:443`. You can use either the [CLI flag format](/storage/docs/cloud-storage-fuse/cli-options#custom-endpoint) or the [configuration file format](/storage/docs/cloud-storage-fuse/config-file#format-and-fields). Both formats are parsed directly by the driver as mount options, so you don't need to supply a separate configuration file. - **CLI format**: `custom-endpoint=storage.s3nsapis.fr:443` - **Configuration file format**: `gcs-connection:custom-endpoint:storage.s3nsapis.fr:443` For more information about specifying mount options, see [Configure mount options](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cloud-storage-fuse-csi-driver-perf#mount-options).

- **Security — Authentication:** Connect gateway is unavailable.
- **Security — Workload identity:** Workload identity pool domains (and the Kubernetes principal identifiers that use them) are specified slightly differently in Google Cloud and Cloud de Confiance by S3NS, using `s3ns.svc.id.goog` rather than `svc.id.goog`. So, for example, when specifying a Kubernetes ServiceAccount using Workload Identity Federation for GKE in an [IAM policy](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity#kubernetes-resources-iam-policies), you use `.../ PROJECT_ID .s3ns.svc.id.goog/subject/ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
- **Security — Node security:** Secure kernel module loading is unavailable.
- **Security — Service agent provisioning:** In Cloud de Confiance, service agents (universe-managed service accounts) are provisioned **Just-In-Time (JIT)** when you create your first resource for a service, rather than when the API is enabled. If you need to grant permissions to a service agent before creating resources (for example, when configuring a [Shared VPC](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-shared-vpc)), you must manually create the service agent and grant it the required default roles. For instructions on how to manually trigger service agent creation grant roles, see [Create and grant roles to service agents](/iam/docs/create-service-agent). Then, grant the default `Kubernetes Engine Service Agent` (`service- PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.s3ns-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) to the agent that you create.
- **Security — GKE Sandbox:** In Cloud de Confiance, only the gVisor sandbox type has been tested for use with GKE Pods.

- **Network — Observability:** GKE Dataplane V2 observability tools are unavailable.
- **Network — Cloud Service Mesh:** Cloud Service Mesh is unavailable.

Because the GKE Hub (Fleet) API is unavailable, the following management and observability features are not supported: - Fleet-level defaults and fleet packages (`ConfigDelivery`). - Centralized management through the Config Sync dashboard in the Cloud de Confiance console. - Integrated dashboards and Cloud Monitoring metrics in the Cloud de Confiance console. You can use local Prometheus scraping (port 8675) for metrics and alerting instead.

- **Regional secret endpoint difference:** Regional secrets use the global base URL (`https://secretmanager.apis-berlin-build0.goog/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/secrets...` or `https://secretmanager.s3nsapis.fr/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/secrets...`) rather than a regional `secretmanager.REGION.rep.googleapis.com` endpoint.
- **API versions:** Only the `v1` API is available (`v1beta1` and `v1beta2` are unavailable).
- **Discovery document:** Querying the REST discovery endpoint (`/$discovery/rest?version=v1&key=API_KEY`) requires passing an explicit API key.
- **Unavailable features and integrations:**
  - GKE Secret Manager add-on
  - Parameter Manager

- **Unavailable CLI tools:**
  - Policy validation with `gcloud beta terraform vet` is unavailable (use native `terraform` checks instead).
  - Bulk resource export with `gcloud beta resource-config bulk-export` is unavailable (use native `terraform import` / configuration generation instead).

  - Berlin: `private.apis-berlin-build0.goog` and `restricted.apis-berlin-build0.goog`
  - S3NS: `private.s3nsapis.fr` (`177.222.88.0/30`) and `restricted.s3nsapis.fr` (`177.222.88.4/30`)
- **Unavailable features:**
  - Private Services Access (service networking peering; use Private Service Connect or Direct Peering depending on the service)
